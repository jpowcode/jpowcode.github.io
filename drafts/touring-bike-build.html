            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>I've started to do a spot of cycling touring. Obviously before doing this I would
need to build a new touring bike. After many hours of internet research where I read
many different opinions I decided on the following build. I will explain my reasoning.</p>
<div class="section" id="frame">
<h2>Frame</h2>
<p>A steel construction by a fantastic little shop specialising in touring bikes
based in the Ambleside in the Lake District. I wanted steel as it is the only
material that can be easily repaired by anyone with basic welding gear pretty much
anywhere in the world. I particularly liked the Ghylside frame as the geometry is s
lightly more akin to a normal road bike rather than a traditional tourer. I thought
this might give a bit more of a lively ride on days when it's not fully laden. It
has wide tire clearance for tires up to about 40mm so could be taken off road. All
the braze on mounts are featured including mudguards and a third bottle cage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bearings">
<h2>Bearings</h2>
<p>I've opted for sealed stainless steel bearings in the headset and the bottom bracket
made by Hope. I know they wouldn't be easy to source in  far flung places if they went
wrong, but I figured they are likely to last for such a long time that this is unlikely
anyway. The bearings could always be replaced before a long trip to minimise risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gears">
<h2>Gears</h2>
<p>This took a good while to figure out. I wanted an 11 speed setup as my wife's touring
bike is 11 speed and it would be helpful to have common spares on a trip. And then
the problems began. I started with a compact chainset and a 32 tooth rear cassette.
A standard Shimano 105 setup. I toured around some of the Scotish Islands for a week
on this. By staying indoors I kept the load down to a single pair of rear panniers.
This worked out ok, just! Some of the hills were a bit of a challenge. My next trip
was going to involve camping and the addition of front panniers and more weight.
Lower gears were needed. I considered a few options</p>
<p>1. Swap the chainset on the front to a triple. The only problem being that Shimano
do not make a triple chainset in 11 speed so I would have to change the entire grouset
back to a 10 speed.</p>
<p>2. Swap the chainset for one such as a <a class="reference external" href="http://hubjub.co.uk/sugino-ox601d-crankset-200-p.asp">Sugino</a>
where the chainrings can be swapped.
This is compatible with a Shimano 11 speed groupset. The downside would be to get
low enough gears I would have to sacrifice some higher gears.</p>
<p>3. Replace the cassette with an 11 speed mountain bike one with a 40 tooth maximum
sprocket and change the derailleur for a moutain bike one. The only problem here is
that Shimano road and mountain bike shifters pull different amount of cable through
to change gear and wanted to keep the road bike shifters. This could be fixed with
downtube friction shifters or barend shifters, but I like the paddle shifters on the
gear leavers and didn't want to give them up.</p>
<p>4. Same as option 3 but make use of a Jtek gear shift pulley to change the amount of
cable pull from the road shifters to make them compatible with the moutanin bike
derailleur. These Jtek pulleys are available to make pretty much any mech compatible
with any shifter. Shimano and capag for example.</p>
<p>In the end I opted for a option 4 with a Shimano XT 11-40 cassette and XT derailleur.
I was a bit dubious that it would work but gave it go anyway. After setting it all up
I was pleasantly surprised. The gears changed nice and smoothly with some nice low
ratios. I added these <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/csn-downtube-cable-stops-pair/?currency=GBP&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw9IS-BRC4qZXagbLs6uMBEiQAYHBh-6VxaSQyRALmidLUsGfyfVd7qaZ50uJCIYW-klpP2bkaArYB8P8HAQ">cable stops</a>
on the dowtube shifter bosses to neaten things up
a bit. They also offer a bit more cable tensioning to adjust the gears.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brakes">
<h2>Brakes</h2>
<p>Tektro cantelevers are the way forward as far as I'm concerned on a touring bike.
They are about as simple as a brake can be, have loads of clearance for big tires
and very little to go wrong with them. The addition of a Textro cable hanger on the
front gave a nice smooth action.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wheels">
<h2>Wheels</h2>
<p>I deliberated for ages on the these. I had a pair of hand built 32 spoke Hope RS
mono hubs with Mavic CXP rims. The hubs have sealed bearings, which similarly to
the other Hope components re not serviceable on the road,  but they last for so
long that this shouldn't be a problem. Loads of forum posts seemed to suggest
some pretty beefy wheels and tires for touring and I was starting to doubt whether
they would do the job. I spoke to Tony the wheel builder at Cycle Art who assured
me they would be absolutely fine. Given he built my race bike wheels that have
seen their fair share of Northumberland potholes and never needed a true I figured
I would trust his judgement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tyres">
<h2>Tyres</h2>
<p>Everyone seems to use Schwalbe Marathons, but they seem really heavy to me. I've
opted for a 28mm Schwalbe Durano plus. Much lighter, but still pretty good
puncture resistance. I've been told I need wider tyres, but I've ridden this
bike fully laden on gravel paths and it's been fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="racks">
<h2>Racks</h2>
<p>I asked the guys at Gyllside what I should get and they gave me Tubus racks.
It's a good job I didn't ask the price at the time as I might have had secon
thoughts. I'm glad I got them though as they are fantastic. Stee, so repairable,
but also light weight due to their tubular construction. And they are rock solid
on the bike, absolutely no play or flex in them whatsoever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pedals">
<h2>Pedals</h2>
<p>Shimano XT SPD's.</p>
<p>The bars, stem and seatpost are nothing special, just random components I had
lying around from other bikes.</p>
<p>After spending two weeks on this bike about the only thing I will change is the
position of the Jtek pulley. I put it right on the rear derailleur, but it pokes
up a bit and my rear panier kept knocking it and I would need to adjust the gear
tension. The pulley can be placed anywhere on the path of cable so I will probably
find a more secure spot for it, maybe somewhere on the downtube.</p>
