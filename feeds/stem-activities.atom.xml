Playing board games is an excellent way for pupils to develop skills such as 
risk management, negotiation, numeracy, reading and comprehension, creativity, logical analysis etc, the list goes on. One of my personal
favorite games is &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames"&gt;CodeNames&lt;/a&gt;. A card game for 4–8 players (but can be played with as many as you like) designed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Chv%C3%A1til"&gt;Vlaada Chvátil&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href="https://czechgames.com/"&gt;Czech Games Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Two teams compete
 by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess 
their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. In a variant with 2–3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other player or players.". During the Coronavirus Pandemic I started playig this with friends online over a Video Chat using the website &lt;a href="https://www.horsepaste.com/"&gt;HorsePaste&lt;/a&gt;.  It occurred to me that if I could use subject based vocabulary then this would be a great game to play with pupils in a STEM club. The Horsepaste website allows you to import your own words. I've put together a spreadsheet of the key words from some STEM subjects to make it easier to filter and find the words I want. You can find this &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fcmNMGNbKsg3SXGi-VGip_DzgDsN8Snz?usp=sharing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see an example in the picture below of what it looks like with subject specific key words. Follow these steps to get it to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the custom words box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the name it gives you to the left of the GO button to something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deselect the current set of words, probably defaults to English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the words from the spreadsheet and add any more you want. They need to be comma separated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the comma from the last word in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click GO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the rules to Codenames &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1fcmNMGNbKsg3SXGi-VGip_DzgDsN8Snz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm always on the lookout for things to physically build with the club. I like getting them to construct things; I feel the younger generations are not so well versed in practical skills as I was at their age. I also like to use up some of the scraps that I produce from woodworking projects at home. 
Whilst browsing Youtube I came across the idea of &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Tensegrity"&gt;tensegrity&lt;/a&gt;. In basic terms it's a design principle making use of tension in wires or strings to replace some of the struts in a structure. It's probably easiest to get a concept of it by searching Google Images. There are lots of pictures of furniture that people have made using the concept. I followed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkCMWrHvyE"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; procedure for creating one, but instead of the lollipop sticks I used some scrap wood and chopped it into equally sized planks on the table saw. The cord is scraps of cotton from the sewing box. You can see the result below. If you are friendly with your technology department then ask them to chop a load of scraps of wood for you. It's a few minutes work with a table saw and a mitre saw. Your art department should have glue-guns you can borrow and the textiles department should be able to provide you with scraps of cotton. I think to improve it I would drill holes through the centers of the corners of the triangles and attache the cord there.&lt;/p&gt;
